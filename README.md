# Solar system

## ✅Overview

This project models the concept of a planet in the solar system. The program provides functionality to represent a planet with various attributes such as mass, volume, diameter, and more. It also includes methods for calculating the planet's density, determining if the planet is an "outer planet" (based on its distance from the Sun), and displaying the planet's information.

## ✅Features

### Planet attributes:
- Name (String)
- Number of satellites (int)
- Mass (double, in kilograms)
- Volume (double, in cubic kilometers)
- Diameter (int, in kilometers)
- Average distance from the Sun (int, in millions of kilometers)
- Planet type (enum: GAS, TERRESTRIAL, DWARF)
- Visible to the naked eye (boolean)
- Orbital period (int, in years)
- Rotation period (int, in days)

### Methods:
- Constructor to initialize the planet's attributes.
- Getter methods for each attribute.
- Method to calculate the planet's density.
- Method to determine if the planet is an "outer planet" based on its distance from the Sun.
- Method to print all planet information, including the calculated density and outer planet status.

```

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Build the project (if needed).
4. Run the App class, which will create two Planet objects (Earth and Venus) and print their details, including their density and whether they are outer planets.
